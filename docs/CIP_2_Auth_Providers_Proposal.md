# CIP-2: Auth Providers Proposal

## Status

Current Status: `Under Discussion`

## **Motivation**

Currently, Chroma does not provide any authentication mechanism. This CIP proposes to
to add authentication abstractions and basic authentication mechanisms to Chroma.

There are intrinsic and extrinsic motivations for this CIP. The intrinsic motivation
is to provide a secure way to access Chroma as adoption grows and the team is gearing up to release a cloud offering.
The extrinsic motivation is driven by the community which is deploying Chroma in both public and private clouds and
in test and production environments. The community has expressed the need for authentication and authorization.

> Observation: We consider the Auth to be applicable to client-server mode.

## **Public Interfaces**

Changes to the public interface are related to the `Settings` class where we introduce new optional attributes to
control server and client-side auth providers.

## **Proposed Changes**

We propose two abstractions, one for the server-side and another for the [client-side.](http://client-side.In) In
addition we also introduce a FastAPI/startlette middleware adapter which will allow using the server-side abstractions
in the context of FastAPI.

### Abstractions

#### Server-side Auth Provider

The server-side authentication provider is responsible for authenticating client requests reaching server endpoints. The
abstraction serves as a way for any server implementation to validate client credentials.

Interface:

- `authenticate(request: AuthRequest) -> bool`

Configuration:

- `CHROMA_SERVER_AUTH_PROVIDER` - a shortname of the provider (configured in a mapping in `__init__.py` of `auth`
  package) - default: `None`. When no provider is specified client request will not be authenticated.

Exposed to the user: Yes

#### Client-side Auth Provider

Exposed to the user: Yes

#### Auth Middleware Adapter

Configuration:

- `CHROMA_SERVER_AUTH_IGNORE_PATHS` - a list of paths that should be ignored by the auth provider -
  default: `['/api/v1', '/api/v1/version', '/api/v1/heartbeat']`. **WARNING**: Usually the defaults are safe but users
  should be careful when overriding this setting as it can lead to security issues.

Exposed to the user: No

#### Client-side Auth Configuration Provider

Exposed to the user: Yes, via settings

#### Server-side Auth Configuration Provider

This is an abstraction layer for auth providers to acquire their configuration. The abstraction is needed as we want to
support a variety of auth providers and each of them might have different configuration requirements.

It is important to note that configuration providers are not explicitly instantiated or configured by the user but
rather are configured by the auth provider itself (using factory pattern).

Configuration:

> Note about provider precedence: The provider precedence is as follows: `env` -> `file` -> `programmatic`. This means
> that if a provider is configured via env var, it will take precedence over the file-based provider. Similarly, if
> both env and file-based providers are configured, the env provider will take precedence over the file-based provider.


File-based configuration:

Use this provider to load configuration from a file:

- `CHROMA_SERVER_AUTH_PROVIDER_CONFIG_FILE_TYPE` - `htpasswd` or `plaintext` - default: `htpasswd`
- `CHROMA_SERVER_AUTH_PROVIDER_CONFIG_FILE` - a path to a file containing the auth provider configuration - default:
  `None`

Env-based configuration provider:

Use this provider to load configuration from environment variables:

- `CHROMA_SERVER_AUTH_PROVIDER_CONFIG_ENV` - an environment variable to use for auth provider configuration - default:
  `None`
- `CHROMA_SERVER_AUTH_PROVIDER_CONFIG_ENV_TYPE` - `plaintext`, `json` or `yaml` - default: `plaintext`

> Note: Additional settings will be added as more config providers are supplied.


Exposed to the user: Yes, via settings

### Client-side Auth Credentials Provider

Exposed to the user: Yes, via settings

#### Server-side Auth Credentials Provider

Exposed to the user: Yes, via settings

Reasoning:

- Server-side abstraction - it is very useful as the intention is to support a variety of auth providers.
- Client-side abstraction - similar reasoning but from client's perspective. It will allow for both standard and
  non-standard auth provider plugins to be added without further impacting the client side
- Backend (fastAPI) adapter - this is a backend-specific way of loading server-side auth provider plugins. It will also
  serve as a template/blueprint when it comes to introducing the auth plugins to another backend framework (e.g. Flask)

We also propose that each auth provider on either side must be configurable via three main methods depending on
developer preference:

- File-base - a configuration file that provides the requisite config and credentials (recommended for production)
- Env - configuration through environment variables (this can also apply for the file-based config, which can be
  specified in env var)
- Programmatically - provide requisite configuration through CLI or directly in code (it is left for the developer to
  decide how such configuration is loaded and made available to the auth provider) - this is possibly the least secure
  and should be used for testing

The intention is to start with two minimal but useful Auth providers:

- Basic Auth - base64 encoded user and password credentials. The credentials will be static in nature and defined via
  auth provider config
- Token - A simple static token implementation

Both of the above providers will rely on the `Authorization` header to achieve their functionality.

> Both initial providers are there to help introduce a bear minimum security but are not recommended for production use

Further work:

- Introduction of JWT and mTLS auth providers
- API Keys
- Chroma managed user store - this would be similar to what standard DBMSâ€™ are doing today - maintain a table with users
  and salted password hashes
- K8s RBAC integration (for cloud-native deployments)
- GCP service accounts?
- SPIFFE and SPIRE integrations
- Go and Java client-side auth providers (for other impl like Rust and Ruby, we need to discuss with respective
  maintainers)

> Note: this CIP intentionally does not tackle authZ but acknowledges that authN and authZ must work in tandem in future
> releases

## **Compatibility, Deprecation, and Migration Plan**

This change, introducing a pluggable auth framework is no impacting compatibility of existing deployments and users can
upgrade and use the new framework without the need for migration.

No deprecations.

## **Test Plan**

We will introduce a new set of tests to verify both client and server-side auth providers.

## **Rejected Alternatives**

We have considered direct middleware Auth or existing third-party libraries for FastAPI integration with auth providers,
but that will create a dependency for Chroma on FastAPI itself.

We have also considered using OAuth 2.0 or OIDC however the challenge there is that both of these protocols are
generally intended for User (human) auth whereas in our case we have a system-to-system auth. That said there still
might be room for either of these protocols, but further more in-depth use case analysis is required.

Relying entirely on external providers, while this is possible not providing out-of-the-box integrated auth capabilities
is a non-starter for many enterprise customers.
